				<h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>

		<p>Volunteers are at the heart of the Families in Transition family. They play a vital role in helping us provide needed support for homeless individuals and families.</p>

<p>FIT provides many different opportunities to its volunteers. In addition to individual volunteers and <a title="Internships" href="http://www.fitnh.org/volunteer/internships" target="_blank">interns</a>, we welcome group efforts and are happy to organize special projects to accommodate your religious organization, school, leisure club, or business group.</p>
