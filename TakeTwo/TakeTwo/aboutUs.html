<h1>Our Mission</h1>

<h2>To provide safe, affordable housing and comprehensive social services<br />
to individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless,<br />
enabling them to gain self-sufficiency and respect.</h2>

<p>Founded as a nonprofit organization in 1991, Families in Transition was formed as response to the growing number of homeless individuals and families in Manchester and throughout the state of New Hampshire. Since its inception, FIT has been committed to providing only the most innovative, comprehensive, and effective programming to help homeless individuals and families reach beyond the cycle of homelessness and lead healthy and successful lives. We believe that having a home is a basic human right and a fundamental component of becoming an engaged and contributing member of the community.</p>
<p>FIT&#39;s unique combination of quality, affordable housing, and comprehensive services has been recognized statewide and nationally as one of the most effective ways to end homelessness. Remaining on the forefront of research and innovation in homeless services, the Families in Transition model empowers homeless individuals and families to lead healthy, happy, and productive lives.</p>
